I am going to do some exploration, publically. First thing that comes to my mind <b>'what people will think'</b> of me. And that is the point I am lost. 'Lost' in the sense, it is no longer an exploration, it will become burden on me. Then what people generally do. It is sure that people will continue their exploration but they will come to the regular way to do so. What do you think is an <b>exploration</b> anymore? But, this may not be true for all of us. Because there are lots of people, who don't care about other people. This is what we have to think. We are brought up under different social restrictions, we are not free for doing whatever we want. We always remained mindful of what we are doing, a background process is always running inside our head <b>'what people will think'</b>. May be they don't even care about us, why should we care? Actually we can't think freely - lots of disturbencd is going through our head. Personally, what I think I really care about, what people will think unless that is going to hurt or affect them and the work I was going to do is never burden on me. So people think before you get into such thoughts - does it matter for you ?
