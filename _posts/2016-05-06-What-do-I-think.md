description:
    - I am going to do some exploration, publically. The first thing comes to my(actually our) mind <b>'what people will think'</b> of me. And that is the point I am done. 'Done' in the sense it is no longer an exploration it will become a burden on me. Then what people do generally, it is sure that people they will continue to their exploration but they will come to the regular way to do so. What do you think is a <b>exploration</b> anymore? But, this may not be true for all of us. Because there are lots of people, who don't care about other people. This is what we have to think. We are brought up under different social restrictions, we are not free for doing whatever we want. We always remained mindful of what we are doing are a background process is always going in our head <b>'what people will think'</b>. May be they don't even care about us, why should we care ?  Actually we can't think free - lots of disturbencd is going through our head. Personally, what I think I really care about what people will think unless that is going to hurt or affect them. And the work I was going to do is never burden on me.
